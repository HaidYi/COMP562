# General Purpose Image Generator by WGAN
Autohrs: Jingyuan Chen, Tenghao Huang, Jiyao Wang, Haidong Yi

Abstract <br>
In this project, we reproduced the implementation of Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) and trained it on several datasets for image generation purpose. The datasets include multi-class natural photos, human face images, and animation character images. Results are measured by Frechet Inception Distance (FID).
